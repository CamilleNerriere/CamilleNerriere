## Featured Projects

### PDF Extractor Tools - [Back](https://github.com/CamilleNerriere/pdf-extractor-tools) / [Front](https://github.com/CamilleNerriere/pdf-extractor-tools-front)
A modular tool for extracting structured content from PDF files — including academic citations and user annotations — with export to PDF, DOCX and TXT formats.

This project performs precise layout and character-level analysis (Unicode, typographic, positional data) to reconstruct complex citation structures and match them to footnotes. It uses PDFBox native annotation detection to handle annotations. It includes a JWT-secured backend (Java Spring Boot) and a lightweight Angular frontend.

It is still in development and you can find a demo [here](https://noesis-pdf-tools.vercel.app/)

> Java · Spring Boot · Angular · PDFBox · Apache POI · H2/PostgreSQL
